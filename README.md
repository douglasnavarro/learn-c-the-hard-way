## Learn C the hard way - Personal report

![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/17?title=progress)

This repository is used to provide an overview of the progress on the Learn C the hard way course. A secondary purpose is to backup code used in exercises, even though there are many repositories on github with those.

I am taking this course to solidify my C knowledge, or as Zed would put it, to 'dust off that compiler'. The goal here is to leave the sloppy C developer behind to write more robust and professional code, performance and redability-wise.

This course is not recommended for beginners and is not recommended as a single reference, as the content is very biased by the author's personal opinion on the language. This made the book very popular as well as controversal, so keep more [traditional](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/562303/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list), alternatives at hand, mainly K&R, which is explictly criticized by Zed in the ending of the book.
