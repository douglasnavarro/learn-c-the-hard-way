## Learn C the hard way - Personal report

![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/17?title=progress)

This repository is used to provide an overview of the progress on the Learn C the hard way course. A secondary purpose is to backup code used in exercises, even though there are many repositories on github with those.

I am taking this course in a preparation phase for an embedded system

This course is not recommended for beginners and is not recommended as a single reference, as the content is very biased by the author's personal opinion on the language. This made the book very popular as well as controversal, so keep more [traditional](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/562303/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list) alternatives at hand.
